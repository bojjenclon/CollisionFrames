This is a small program made with Electron to help setup collision shapes for animations in a game.

Current Features:
* Open multiple images at once
* Add images to the currently opened list of images
* Rearrange the order of the images in the "animation"
* Add primitive collision shapes (rectangle and ellipse) per image
* Save info for all images in the "animation" to a JSON file

Current Limitations:

* Animations must consist of individual image files

Planned Features:
